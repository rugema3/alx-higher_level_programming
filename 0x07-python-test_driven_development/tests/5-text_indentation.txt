is encountered. The special characters include: ., ? and :

>>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation

# Testing a single word
>>> text_indentation("Rwanda?")
Rwanda?

# Testing non-string
>>> text_indentation(23)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: The 'text' argument must be a string.

# Testing an empty argument
>>> text_indentation()
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: text_indentation() missing 1 required positional argument: 'text'

# Testing multiple words
>>> text_indentation("Hello.Rwanda,did you forget about about me? here I am.")
Hello.
<BLANKLINE>
Rwanda,did you forget about about me?
<BLANKLINE>
